# despite the tragic formatting it's still getting a significantly higher similarity score for the relevant article
# obviously more testing would be needed, in particular for adjacent areas of science
# Could potentially be used 'as is' to provide a confidence score for whether an article is based in truth,
# but the real value would come from being to identify what in the article is accurate and what isn't

# break the individual blocks of text into more valuable individual sentences
# perform semantic similarity on all pairs in source and reference
# scores greater than x are considered a good match and likely indicate accuracy, lack of indicates inaccurate information
